          Hey there! I'm Pavneet Kaur, and I'm studying Computer Programming full-time at Seneca College. You know, when I was a kid, I never imagined I'd be creating websites someday! From those days of playing with blocks to now diving into both the front and back ends of web development, it's been quite the journey. Currently, I'm in my third semester at college.
          Originally from Amritsar, a beautiful city in northern India known for the Golden Temple, I've always had a passion for blending creativity with technology. When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in painting or enjoying a lively game of table tennis. Life's all about balance, isn't it?
          So that's me â€“ always up for a challenge and ready to learn something new, whether it's coding or creating art!
